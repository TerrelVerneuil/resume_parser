# Resume Parser

## Overview
This project is a web application designed to parse and evaluate resumes to help employers identify the best candidates for a job position. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract and analyze relevant information from resumes and match them against a job description. The application supports mass import of resumes and ranks the top 5 candidates based on their relevance to the job specifications.

## Objectives
- Extract specific information from resumes to identify the best candidates.
- Provide a fair alternative to traditional keyword matching by evaluating multiple criteria.
- Enable mass import of resumes and ranking of the top 5 candidates based on their relevance to the job description.

## Technologies Used
- **Flask**: For building the web application.
- **PyPDF2**: For extracting text from PDF resumes.
- **NLTK**: For text tokenization and preprocessing.
- **SentenceTransformers**: For generating sentence embeddings.
- **TensorFlow**: For neural network operations.
- **scikit-learn**: For TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity calculations.

## How It Works
1. **Upload Resumes**: Users can upload multiple PDF resumes through the web interface.
2. **Job Description Input**: Users input the job description against which the resumes will be evaluated.
3. **Text Extraction**: PDF resumes are converted to text using PyPDF2.
4. **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization and text normalization using NLTK.
5. **Keyword Extraction**: Extracts top keywords from the job description using TF-IDF.
6. **Skills Extraction**: Identifies the skills section in each resume.
7. **Embedding Generation**: Generates embeddings for the job description and resume skills using SentenceTransformers.
8. **Similarity Calculation**: Computes cosine similarity between job description embeddings and resume embeddings.
9. **Scoring**: Combines similarity scores and keyword matching scores to rank candidates.
10. **Results Display**: Displays the top 5 candidates based on their combined scores.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/resume-parser.git
   cd resume-parser


pip install -r requirements.txt

python app.py

Usage

Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
Upload PDF resumes and enter the job description.
Click the "Submit" button to process the resumes.
View the top 5 candidates on the results page.
